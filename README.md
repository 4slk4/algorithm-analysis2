Hypothesis
1. Exhaustive search algorithms are feasible to implement and produce correct outputs.
2. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too slow to be of practical use.

To test these hypotheses, I implement an exhaustive search and a dynamic programming version of the Soccer Avoidance Problem and compare their running times.
